## Few Best Online Editors:
(personal opinion*)
Editors are softwares that allows you to execute HTML codes. There several amazing editors available for mac like coda or even adobe dreamweaver. These softwares are not free and not all has live preview capabilities-- Wait I even hope you check notepad, notepad++, Atom, Sublime Text also. 
Like there are really many options. I found these when I wanted to ofc. Following are few online Html Editors
1. Codepen ( I am using this one , the online html editor)
2. JSfiddle ( If you are from stackoverflow you might know this one )
3. HTML instant ( Fast but it doesn't have color-color thing, I mean the synatax highlights)
4. HTML edit ( Loads super fast, free also ads free )
5. Glitch ( This one is in its beta stage but trying is not a problem )
